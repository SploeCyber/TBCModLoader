## Getting Started

Go to the [help](https://github.com/fieryhenry/bcgm_mod_manager/blob/master/help.md) page to find out how to use the tool

## Mods

Mods are in the format of a `.bcmod` file and can be shared and imported with the `Load mods from .bcmod files` option.

You can find examples of mods [here](https://github.com/fieryhenry/bcgm_mod_manager/tree/master/example_mods)

All mods are automatically enabled when they are loaded, but can be disabled with the option to `Mod Management -> Disable mods`. These won't be loaded into the game apk.

You can view your mods with the `Display mods` option.
